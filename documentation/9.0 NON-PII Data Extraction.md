## **8.0 NON-PII DATA EXTRACTION**

Yes, the Doptor Open Data platform may collect and use non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data and/or content. Non-PII data refers to information that cannot be used to directly identify an individual.

Mechanism for extracting or importing non-PII data from or into the system in a non-proprietary format:

The Doptor Open Data platform provides a mechanism for extracting or importing non-PII data from or into the system in a non-proprietary format. This mechanism ensures interoperability and facilitates the exchange of data with external systems or applications.

The specific details of the extraction or import mechanism may depend on the implementation of the platform. However, in general, the platform can adopt the following approaches:

- API-based Data Exchange: The platform can offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow external systems or applications to programmatically extract or import non-PII data. These APIs provide standardized endpoints and data formats for seamless integration.
- Data Export/Import Functionality: The platform may provide built-in export and import functionalities within its user interface. Users with appropriate permissions can initiate the export or import process, specifying the desired data and format.

By providing these mechanisms, the Doptor Open Data platform allows for the extraction or import of non-PII data in a non-proprietary format. This promotes data interoperability, enhances data sharing capabilities, and facilitates integration with external systems or applications.
